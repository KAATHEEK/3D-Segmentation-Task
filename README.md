# 3D-Segmentation-Task

Overview

This project aims to develop a 3D segmentation model for the accurate identification and segmentation of abdominal organs, specifically the Liver, Right Kidney, Left Kidney, and Spleen, from CT scan images. The model is built using the VNet architecture, which is well-suited for medical image segmentation tasks. The primary objective is to achieve high segmentation accuracy, measured using the Dice score for each organ.

Model Architecture

The segmentation model is based on the VNet architecture, which is specifically designed for volumetric medical image segmentation. Key features of the architecture include:

-Input: 3D volumetric data (CT scans).
-Encoder-Decoder Structure: VNet employs a fully convolutional network with an encoder-decoder structure, capturing spatial hierarchies while preserving fine details.
-Residual Blocks: Utilizes residual blocks to improve gradient flow and training stability.
-Skip Connections: Facilitates the combination of coarse and fine feature maps, aiding in accurate boundary delineation.
The model is optimized to handle the complexity of segmenting multiple organs in a 3D space.

Model Architecture
The segmentation model is based on the VNet architecture, which is specifically designed for volumetric medical image segmentation. Key features of the architecture include:

Input: 3D volumetric data (CT scans).
Encoder-Decoder Structure: VNet employs a fully convolutional network with an encoder-decoder structure, capturing spatial hierarchies while preserving fine details.
Residual Blocks: Utilizes residual blocks to improve gradient flow and training stability.
Skip Connections: Facilitates the combination of coarse and fine feature maps, aiding in accurate boundary delineation.
The model is optimized to handle the complexity of segmenting multiple organs in a 3D space.

Training Process
The training process involves the following key steps:

1.Data Preprocessing:
CT scan volumes are normalized to have zero mean and unit variance.
Data augmentation techniques, such as random rotations, flips, and intensity variations, are applied to enhance model robustness.
Each 3D volume is divided into smaller patches to fit into GPU memory.

2.Training:
The model is trained using the Dice loss function, which directly optimizes the overlap between predicted and true segmentations.
A learning rate scheduler and early stopping mechanism are employed to prevent overfitting.

Validation and Inference

Validation
-During training, the model's performance is validated using a separate subset of the dataset.
-The Dice score, a common metric for segmentation tasks, is computed for each organ. The Dice score measures the overlap between the predicted and ground truth segmentations, with a value ranging from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap).

Inference
-For inference, the trained model is applied to new CT scan volumes to predict the segmentation masks for the liver, right kidney, left kidney, and spleen.
-The predicted masks are evaluated using the Dice score, and additional metrics like precision, recall, and volume overlap may be considered for further analysis.

3D Visualization
A key part of this project is visualizing the segmentation results in 3D. The provided script generates a video demonstrating the 3D-rendered segments of the predicted organs.

To generate the visualization:
python visualize.py --input <predicted-masks-path> --output <output-video-path>

The output video will showcase the segmented organs, providing a clear visual representation of the model's performance.
